pyhms Examples
==============

pyhms has the ability to download, open, and plot HMS products. At this time, only smoke has a plotting utility. This is an extremely simple wrapper around geopandas, but hopefully it is useful.


The examples assume that you have installed pyhms:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/barronh/pyhms.git


After that, you can copy or download the code to run it.

If something is unclear, feel free to open an `issue <https://github.com/barronh/pyhms/issues>`_.
