pyhms User's Guide
===================

`pyhms` is a python tool to plots of HMS products from NOAA. This is a
very simple wrapper around geopandas, and is mostly a way for me to share
the tools that I have in a more systematic way.


Getting Started
---------------

The best way to get started is to install (see below) and then explore the
:doc:`auto_examples/index`. The examples include data download, processing,
and create summaries of the data (figures and tables).


Installation
------------

Right now, you can get the latest version of `pyhms` with this command.

.. code-block::

    pip install git+https://github.com/barronh/pyhms.git


Issues
------

If you're having any problems, open an issue on github.
